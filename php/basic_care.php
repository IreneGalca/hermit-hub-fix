                    Most hermit crabs you buy from pet stores are wild caught, due to the difficulty of breeding them in captivity. So we have to try our best to encapsulate a small part of their home within the limited space of our tank at home. Before we start talking about how to properly set up a crabitat, it is important to note that hermit crabs do NOT live on the beach. They are scavengers and will often visit the shore to hunt for food and shells. Hermit crabs tend to live more inland on a regular basis within the humid environment amongst the trees. They are more akin to rainforest creatures than beach creatures, so it is important to keep this in mind as we build their crabitat.

            <h3 id="tank_size">Tank Size</h3>
                <p>Hermit crabs love to wander and climb. Since most hermit crabs are wild caught, it’s a huge adjustment to go from a wide open shoreline to the limited space of a tank. It is also important to take space into consideration as smaller spaces can cause hermit crabs to feel cramped and become aggressive. Ideally the amount of space needed to ensure proper space per crab is approximately 10 gallons per crab. You can allow about 5-10 gallons of space per crab, but the ideal amount of space for each crab to live comfortably is 10 gallons per crab.</p>

            <h3 id="what_tank">What kind of tank can I use?</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, the most ideal enclosure for hermit crabs is a glass tank. DO NOT USE CRITTER KEEPERS! Critter keepers do not provide adequate space for permanent living and can get easily scratched and build bacteria over time. You can however use a critter keeper as a temporary isolation tank for surface molting, ill, or aggressive crabs.

                Depending on how many crabs you have, the cost for a proper sized tank can get pretty pricey (you can purchase glass tanks from PetSmart during their $1 per gallon seasonal sale, so be on the lookout for those). However, if money is tight there is an alternative. You can in fact use a plastic tote as an enclosure for your hermit crabs. There are many benefits to using totes as a habitat:
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Totes are more affordable and come in a huge variety of sizes.</li>
                        <li>If you wish to upgrade size, you can either buy a new unit, or add onto the one you have.</li>
                        <li>Heat and humidity are usually easier to maintain in totes as opposed to glass tanks.</li>
                        <li>Decorating is easier in totes. You can drill holes into the totes and use zip ties to hold plants or climbing toys.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    The main disadvantages of totes however, is that they’re not as attractive as glass tanks, and if you love watching your hermies, it can be very difficult to do so with a tote. They aren’t as clear as glass tanks. When using a tote the set up is the same as with a glass tote. You can even heat the tote the same way, using a U.T.H. attached to the side.

            <h3 id="climbing_toys">Climbing Toys/Hiding Places</h3>
                <p> 
                Hermit crabs are extremely adept tree climbers. So it is important for them to have lots of places to climb. You can place branches in the tank to give them more climbing room. Some recommended woods and branches are Ghostwood, Grapewood, and Cholla wood.
                </p>

            <h3 id="substrate">Substrate</h3>
                <p>
                The substrate may just be the most important part of the habitat. As it will have a huge impact on how the humidity and temperature are maintained. It also helps to organically break down matter, such as feces, leftover exoskeleton, leaves, or uneaten food. As stated before, Hermit crabs generally live more inland. Therefore their substrate is more of a happy medium between soil and sand. This allows the substrate to be at an ideal digging consistency so that crabs can bury themselves to destress or safely molt.

                     Hermit crabs are omnivores and scavengers by nature. There are several key nutrients required in order for a hermit crab to thrive in captivity. Since we are their main source of food now, it is important for us to give them the proper nutrition they need to safely and properly molt, regenerate and grow. It’s important to offer them a wide variety of foods so they can eat the nutrients their little bodies need. Here is a food pyramid demonstrating what their options should be daily, and how they can be moderated if needed (from most important foods at the bottom to everything else at the top).
